### 🚀 Dev Mindset
- 🧼 **Keep it Minimal** – No bloat, no BS. Just fast, clean logic.

### 📈 What Drives Me
- Building tools that actually *do something useful*
- Making things that run anywhere — even offline, even on weak hardware
- Keeping it clean, modular, and tweakable for the next dev down the line
